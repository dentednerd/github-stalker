# Github Stalker

A project created from the [Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q) tutorial [TypeScript Basics](https://javabrains.i0/course/typescript_basics).

Look up a Github account's repo count, follower count, and five biggest repos.

(The tutorial project looks up a user's five most forked repos, but because I are n00b and don't have any forked repos, I went with largest codebases instead.)

## Installation

```bash
// Clone this repo:
git clone git@github.com:dentednerd/github-stalker.git
cd github-stalker

// Install dependencies:
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start your-github-username
```
